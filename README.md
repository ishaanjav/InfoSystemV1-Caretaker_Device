# CaretakerDevice
## Purpose/Background

**The purpose of this Android application is to serve as part of a system of 3 apps that collects information about visits to the house. The system is intended to serve at the homes of those with declining cognitive abilities such as patients with Alzheimer's or other types of dementias because these patients have difficulty recognizing faces and therefore have trouble identifying the visitor that has come to see them. This app, in particular, is for the patient's caretaker who can view events that the system logs, approve or decline accounts of new visitors, track the patient if they get lost, and analyze their emotions.**

Rather than just providing information about visitors to the patient, the patient's caretaker will also receive useful information through this app. The system not only helps the patient better *understand* who is visiting them, but also keeps a record of information for their caretaker.
